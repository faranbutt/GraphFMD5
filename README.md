# 💵 GraphFMD: Graph based Financial Misconduct Detection

**GraphFMD** is a benchmark competition for detecting illicit transactions on the Bitcoin network. Using GNN and the **Elliptic Dataset**, participants must identify fraudulent activity within a complex transaction graph.

This repository is designed for **Human vs. LLM** task.

## 🚀 How to Participate

To ensure the secrecy of the test labels and participant data, we use a **Secure Submission Portal**.

### Step 1: Prepare your Files
You must prepare two files:

1. **`predictions.csv`**: Must contain exactly two columns: `id` and `y_pred`.
   - `1`: Illicit (Fraudulent)
   - `2`: Licit (Legal)
2. **`metadata.json`**: A short description of your approach.

```json
{
  "team": "Your_Team_Name",
  "run_id": "run_01/run_02.... etc",
  "author_type": "human / llm / hybrid",
  "model": "GCN / GraphSAGE / etc.",
  "notes": "Briefly describe your layers/hyperparameters"
}


```

### Step 2: Upload to the Submission Portal
Submit your files via the official Google Form:  
👉 **[Official Submission Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdyqFftCdnH3SAn6AFBVu3qUpG_MUXNSyRssUcw9RKqh9V-nw/viewform?usp=dialog)**

### Step 3: Automated Scoring
Once you submit the form:
* A **GitHub Action** is triggered automatically.
* Your model is scored against the **Hidden Ground Truth**.
* The **Leaderboard** is updated instantly.


## 1. Task Overview

* **Task:** Binary Node Classification (Licit vs. Illicit).
* **Domain:** Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin) Forensics.
* **Target:** Predict the probability that a transaction is **Illicit (Class 1)**.
* **Metric:** **F1-Score** (calculated specifically on the Illicit class).

## 2. The Data
* **Nodes:** Bitcoin transactions.
* **Edges:** The flow of BTC between transactions.This is adjancecy matrix (edgelist.csv).
* **Features:** 165 local and aggregate features.

**Train-set size** = 16658

**Test-set size** = 8896


## 3. Difficulty level:
- **Feature Noise** Gaussian noise was added to make the features simulate real world noisy data. 
- **Temporal Shifiting:** Time-based split (Train: 1–34, Test: 35+)
- **Artificial Class Imbalance:** Preserving 100% of illicit nodes while sampling only 50% of licit nodes.
- **High Sparsity:** Removed 50% of licit nodes and 100% unknowns to make the make the graph structure significantly more sparse.




## 4. Submission Policy:
For maintaining fairness and competition competency
- One submission policy is enforced so you are only allowed to do one form submission


## 6. Submission Format

To enter the competition, you must submit a CSV file named exactly prediction.csv inside the submissions/ folder.

```csv
submissions/participant1/prediction.csv
id,y_pred
6418,1
7952,2
.....
.....
```
id: Transaction ID (must match test_nodes.csv).

y_pred: The predicted class label:

- 1: Illicit (Fraudulent)
- 2: Licit (Legal)



## 7. Automated Validation Checks:
When a Pull Request is opened the bot will
- Check identity (Verify if you have already submitted)
- Check Formats (Ensure your JSON and CSV files are structured properly)
